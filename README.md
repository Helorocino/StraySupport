# StraySupport

<a href="https://ftadii.github.io/StraySupport/">StraySupport<a>

The primary aim of our website is to aid individuals who have selflessly volunteered themselves to
help stray animals. We believe that these everyday heroes deserve recognition and support for their
noble acts.

Our website serves as a platform for these volunteers to share their stories and experiences with
others. We encourage them to use our website as a tool to connect with other like-minded
individuals, exchange tips and resources, and seek guidance on how to better care for stray animals.

In addition to serving as a community for volunteers, our website also provides information on
animal welfare laws, veterinary care, and training resources for those interested in becoming a
volunteer themselves. We strive to make our website a one-stop-shop for all things related to stray
animal welfare.

Overall, our dedication to supporting everyday heroes who volunteer their time and effort to help
stray animals is the driving force behind our website. We hope to create a community that will
inspire others to join in this noble cause and make a positive impact on the lives of animals in
need.
